- AWS account opening with same gmail - 
    - myemail@gmail can be used like this myemail + `ANYTHING` @ gmail.com , for example using `myemail@gmail` we can open two aws accounts like myemail+account01@gmail  and myemail+account02@gmail , using + we can use the same email and create alias about which AWS is generous.
- AWS Identity Center (formerly known as AWS Single Sign-On or SSO)
    - Provides a single login across
        - All AWS accounts (leveraging AWS Organizations)
        - Cloud-based applications like Salesforce, Box, Microsoft 365
        - EC2 instances running Windows
        - SAML 2.0-enabled applications
    - We login and see all our AWS accounts (and apps) and select where to go.
    - AWS Console access, this is the recommended way, AWS seems to headed in this direction.
    - As of now we have to enable it! And we can only enable it in one region.
    - Requires AWS Organization.


# AWS Purchase Orders

## Overview

**Purchase Orders (POs)** in AWS are documents that customers can create within their AWS account to help manage and track their spending. A Purchase Order in the context of AWS is essentially a financial document provided by the customer to AWS that indicates a commitment to purchase services or products up to a certain amount.

## Purpose and Use Case

- **Budget Management**: Purchase Orders allow organizations to manage and control their AWS spending. By creating a PO, organizations can allocate specific budgets for different departments, projects, or cost centers.

- **Tracking and Reconciliation**: POs help in tracking spending against a predefined budget. When AWS services are consumed, the charges are tracked against the relevant PO, making it easier to reconcile invoices with internal financial records.

- **Vendor Management**: POs are often required by organizations as part of their procurement process to authorize purchases from vendors (in this case, AWS). They serve as a formal request or order for AWS services and ensure that all spending is pre-approved.

- **Compliance**: Some organizations have policies that require POs for all expenditures to maintain compliance with internal or external financial regulations. AWS supports this by allowing customers to link POs to their AWS accounts.

## Purpose of Multiple Line Items in Purchase Orders

- **Detailed Budgeting**: Multiple line items in a PO allow organizations to allocate specific amounts of money for different AWS services, projects, or departments. For example, a single PO might have different line items for different AWS accounts, regions, or services like EC2, S3, RDS, etc.

- **Expense Segregation**: By using multiple line items, organizations can segregate expenses, making it easier to track and report costs associated with different areas of the business. This is particularly useful in large organizations where different departments may need to be billed separately.

- **Granular Control**: Multiple line items provide granular control over the budget. Each line item can have its own set of instructions, amounts, and conditions, allowing more precise control over how funds are used.

- **Simplified Reconciliation**: When invoices are generated by AWS, they can be matched against specific line items in the PO, simplifying the reconciliation process. This reduces the likelihood of errors and helps in ensuring that all spending is aligned with the organization's budget.

## Example Use Case

Let's say a company has a monthly budget of $50,000 for AWS services, which they want to split across different departments:

1. **Line Item 1**: $20,000 for the Development Department, covering EC2 and S3 usage.
2. **Line Item 2**: $15,000 for the Marketing Department, covering RDS and CloudFront usage.
3. **Line Item 3**: $10,000 for the Operations Department, covering Lambda and DynamoDB usage.
4. **Line Item 4**: $5,000 for miscellaneous expenses, like support costs or unforeseen service usage.

Each department is responsible for ensuring that their AWS usage stays within their allocated budget. The PO helps the finance team track and reconcile AWS invoices against these specific budget allocations.

## Summary

- Create a PO and refer it during market place purchase or other purchases, AWS Incoice will have the PO number, the amount will be deducted from the PO(balance tracking needs to be enabled), an alert will be generated to the PO focals in balance low or utilised, comes under billing console, can choose validity period.
- Purchase order management is not available for linked accounts.
